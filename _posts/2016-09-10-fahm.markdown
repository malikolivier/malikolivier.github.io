## An Arabic Pop-up dictionary

After having started to learn Arabic, I was frustrated by the lack of Arabic pop-up
dictionary. I was looking for something similar to [rikaichan](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaichan/)
or [Zhongwen](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zhongwen-chinese-english/kkmlkkjojmombglmlpbpapmhcaljjkde?hl=en)
for Japanese and Chinese.

Arabic, like Japanese or Chinese has a writing system for which inferring the reading
is not straightforward. I wanted a way to easily look up a word vocalization
(i.e. via a small pop-up).

As far as I know, such pop-up dictionary did not exist until I made
[Fahm](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fahm-arabic-pop-up-dictio/nmndkfhbopdpiocgcfkmppalkfjjgehe) ("فهم", meaning "understanding"), an extension for Google Chrome.
Basically, hovering your mouse over any Arabic word inside your browser will open a pop-up window containing a translation.

## Fahm


Look-up results include vocalization, English translation, stem, word category and a morphological
analysis. Morphological analysis and dictionary files that are used are
based on the [Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer](http://www.qamus.org/morphology.htm). Of course,
a single look-up can retrieve more than one morphological match; it
is left to the user to infer the correct match in the given context. This
extension allows even beginners of Arabic to enjoy online content
as soon as they start, while it unmistakenly saves advanced learner
from having to look up a word manually in a dictionary whenever
they find a word whose meaning or pronunciation is unknown.
