## Web development chronicles


![Are your a web-developer with 10 years experience? Or a web-developer that repeated same year 10 times?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equivalent/equivalent.github.io/master/assets/2018/10-year-experience.jpg)


We'll go through a chronology of front-end web development.

During the stone age, people would use vanilla javascript to do simple stuff:
pop-up, small animation, etc.
Front-end developers had to write obscure conditional statements to detect
the host browser and then adapt their code to each browser.
They always had the same question: "[Can I use](https://caniuse.com/) this feature?"

It was obvious to everyone by then that the browser gods were badly behaved.
As such, the warrior jQuery rose up to tame them.

jQuery encapsulated behaviours behind a consistent API. At first, people
would still do simple stuff with jQuery: some dynamic buttons, some AJAX.

But then, what some high-minded people called "web 2.0" came about.
By then, everything should be JavaScript. The era of Single Page App (SPA)
appeared. People stop calling a program, a "program", but started calling it an
"app".

"Apps" grew more complex. So complex that jQuery alone as a dependency would not
be sufficient. Some even chose to get rid of jQuery altogether.
JS frameworks started to pop up: Angular, Backbone, Meteor, React, Vue to name a
few out of the most popular ones.

These frameworks would do "client-side rendering". Which is a practical way to name
the despicable practice of stealing CPU cycles from your users to make up for
cheaper servers.

Add to that that you may use any kind of CSS framework as will, like [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/) or [Font Awesome](https://origin.fontawesome.com/).

## Dependency management

As "apps" grew in complexities, so does dependency management.
Any software enginner will tell you, you need to guarantee the full
reproducibility of your build.

For that you need to explicitly records, not only your own code, but your exact
dependencies as well.

Would you expect that the output of a car factory manufacturing a single
model of car to be variable? Whereas one day the brand new car out of the
factory would use "brake-magic v1.2.4", the next day cars using "brake-magic v1.2.5"
would be automatically out. As the car industry knows, each time you update a single dependency,
the whole system must be audited again. "brake magic v1.2.5" may introduce a regression,
or it may even contain [malware](https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes).

Once the system is audited, you need to freeze all dependencies, until the next audit.

A lot of methods exist for front-end dependency management. Front-end is especially
complex because of the way styles, JavaScript and other assets such as icons and images
are intertwined together.

The easiest method is to copy-paste `jquery-1.2.4.min.js` (or whichever distribution
files your dependency provides) into your repository and link it using a \<script></script> tag.

However, when you have tens of assets to manage this way, it quickly becomes very hard to manage.
You app will be filled by global variables. You will spend time checking if the `js`
libraries are included in the correct order (e.g. jQuery should be imported before Bootstrap,
which should be imported before [Bootstrap UI](http://www.bootstrap-ui.com/)).
When releasing for production, to minimize bandwidth, you will want to concatenate and
minimize all your JS files. However, you will need to record which version of what tool you used
during the release process to have a reproducible build.
Clearly, there must be a better way that doing all of the manually.
That is why serious front-end developers use two kinds of tools together: a dependency management
tool and a task runner.

The dependency management tool will resolve dependency graphs and fetch the right
versions of your dependencies from (usually) trusted repositories.

The build tool will compile/optimize your hand-written assets into something the
browser can deal with.

## Dependency management tools

JS has had many dependency management tools. New ones are appearing every year.

| Tool | Pro | Con |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| [bower](https://bower.io/) | Very configurable. Just download your assets and you are responsible for importing them in your app | Deprecated for new projects in favor of npm/yarn |
| [npm](http://npmjs.com/) | Node's default package manager | Historically known to produce tree-like non-reproducible build |
| [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) | Produce flat and deterministic builds. Faster than npm at time of writing. | As it is relativity new, community is smaller compared to the npm community |

We will not go into details for `bower` as even bower maintainers advise to refrain
from using it in new projects.

All these tools use [node](http://nodejs.org/) as runtime. You will need to install
node first to run any of them.

`npm` and `yarn` are very much alike. They use the exact same `package.json` format,
so you can mostly replace one with the other in the blink of an eye.

I would choose yarn for a new project because yarn is faster and its `yarn.lock`
file to freeze dependencies is easier to visually parse compared to the `package-lock.json`
that newer versions of npm provide (probably npm >=5.x).

When you have a `package.json` like the one below in your working directory, just run
`yarn install` or `npm install` to install all your dependencies locally.

### package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch --mode=development --progress --profile --colors",
    "build": "node_modules/.bin/webpack --progress --profile --colors"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free": "^5.3.0",
    "bootstrap": "^3.3.5",
    "jquery": "^2.1.4",
    "moment": "^2.20.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "css-loader": "^1.0.0",
    "file-loader": "^2.0.0",
    "manifest-revision-webpack-plugin": "^0.4.1",
    "style-loader": "^0.23.0",
    "webpack": "^4.17.1",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.1.0"
  }
}
```

Dependencies will be stored into the `node_modules` directory.
We will now see how the build tools are used to turn all this mess into something
usable by a browser.

## Build tools

Did you see that we had some `devDependencies`? These dependencies comprise my build
tool of choice: [webpack](http://webpack.js.org/). Please be aware than many combinations of
altenatives exist ([grunt](https://gruntjs.com/),
[gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), [browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[parcel](https://parceljs.org/)).

Webpack offer than advantages of being an all-in-one tool that will bundle all
your assets into a single (or several) files.

[![Webpack bundles everything for you](/images/webpack/webpack.png)](http://webpack.js.org)

You will just need to fill out a file: `webpack.config.js` by following the high-quality
online documentation. Here is an example of webpack.config.js:

### webpack.config.js

```js
const webpack = require("webpack");

const path = require('path');

const ManifestRevisionPlugin = require('manifest-revision-webpack-plugin');

// Define where all your assets are stored
const rootAssetPath = './assets';

module.exports = {
    entry: {
        // Defines at least one entry point for your program. Here `assets/index.js`
        index: [
            `${rootAssetPath}/index.js`,
        ],
    },
    output: {
        // Define output directory
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'static', 'build'),
        // Define naming rules for the output file
        filename: '[name].[chunkhash].js',
        chunkFilename: '[id].[chunkhash].js'
    },
    module: {
        // Define how each file type should be bundled
        rules: [
            {
                // Use regex to match files by filename
                test: /\.css$/i,
                // Define the "pipeline" to bundle the matched file
                use: [
                    { loader: 'style-loader' },
                    { loader: 'css-loader' },
                ]
            },
            {
                test: /\.(svg|eot|woff2|woff|ttf)$/,
                loader: 'file-loader',
                options: {
                    publicPath: '/static/build',
                    name: '[name]-[hash:6].[ext]',
                },
            },
        ]
    },
    plugins: [
        // Creates a manifest.json file containing the mapping from entry point to output files
        // May be convenient for integration with other tools (e.g. Flask-Webpack).
        new ManifestRevisionPlugin(path.join('build', 'manifest.json'), {
            rootAssetPath,
        }),
        // Make jQuery a global variable accessible everywhere in your app.
        // If you use Bootstrap JS, you will need this as bootstrap expects
        // jQuery to be globally defined.
        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
            $: "jquery",
            jQuery: "jquery"
        }),
    ],
    mode: "production",
};
```

You `assets/index.js` may look like (written in ES6):

```js
import BootstrapStyles from "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"
import FontAwesomeStyles from "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.css"

import jQuery from "jquery"
import moment from "moment"

import "bootstrap"

// ... You application's logic here
```

As you can see, all imports (CSS, JS, images, etc.) are treated in the same way.

To build your assets for production, run `yarn build` (or `npm build`).
To watch your assets and rebuild them as your code, run `yarn start` (or `npm start`).

These shortcut commands will run the respective commands defined in the
`scripts` property of `package.json`.

In any case, all your resources will be bundled into a single, optimized `index.[chunkhash].js`,
saving bandwidth and loadtime for your end user.
Moreover, you will never have any headache when managing dependencies.
To upgrade, just change a version number in `package.json`, then rerun `yarn install`.
Then audit your code.
