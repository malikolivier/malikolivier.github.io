Word etymology in computer science can be interesting.
Most are knowledgeable about the origin of the word "bug" for example (An
insect was found roasted to death inside a mainframe, causing short-circuits,
that's what Grace Hopper called the first computer "bug"). Though the word
has been is used at least since Thomas Edison's time.
And when you must find the bug, you "debug", with a "debugger". Funny, right?

You may know that as most break-through technology of the 20th century, computing
was first started by the military, as an answer to the necessary war effort.
And here we are, computing still has several words whose use was limited to
warfare or military strategies before their advent in computing.


## Staging

The staging area originally means the area where military personnel is
stationing before going to mission.
There dictionary says:

*"Stage: To move (as military personnel, supplies, or equipment) to or establish in a new base in preparation for a further movement or a planned operation."* â€”Webster's Third New International Dictionary

In computer science, it is used in several contexts. The mainly known use for
contemporary programmer is probably the staging environment.
Before an application is deployed into production, most businesses (hopefully)
will thoroughly check/test the program before sending it to production use.
Before sending anything into production, it should be *battle*-tested.

Staging area is a term used in the hugely popular VCS [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics).

%}

Git staging area can be quite confusing for beginners, but it is a powerful
feature that allows you to selectively add changes from the working directory
to the repository, using for example the `git add --patch` feature.

## Deploy

As we just hinted at above, *deployment* is also a military term, designating
the strategic spreading of troops on the battle stage.

Are we using military term too lightly? Probably not, when your business heavily
relies on a web application, the right deployment of your application is critical
to the success of your venture.

## Cache

Cache is a very funny word, which has been used since the very beginning of modern
computing. Myself included, I suppose no few people have been using the word
without even thinking about where it comes from.

The first definition that pops ups on *Dictionary.com* is *a hiding place,
especially one in the ground, for ammunition, food, treasures, etc.*.
In computing, a cache is any kind of temporary storage space that allows fast
access to data. For example, if you've seen this page before, some of its
content has probably been cached by your browser so that it does not need to
reload a data from the web. Indeed, accessing a PC's internal storage is much
faster than getting contents with an HTTP request.
