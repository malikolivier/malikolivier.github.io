Word etymology in computer science can be interesting.
Most are knowledgeable about the origin of the word "bug" for example (An
insect was found roasted to death inside a mainframe, causing short-circuits,
that's what Grace Hopper called the first computer "bug"). Though the word
has been is used at least since Thomas Edison's time.
And when you must find the bug, you "debug", with a "debugger". Funny, right?

You may know that as most break-through technology of the 20th century, computing
was first started by the military, as an answer to the necessary war effort.
And here we are, computing still has several words whose use was limited to
warfare or military strategies before their advent in computing.
