## Some code snippets for Node

AWS provides two documentations:

- [GettingStarted](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/gettingstartedguide/GettingStarted.NodeJs.html): The bare minimum to survive in this hostile world. We would like to have more info though.
- [The Exhaustive one](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/DynamoDB.html): This one in a torture to read. Though everything is there. However, no example, no code snippet. Only bare doc.
