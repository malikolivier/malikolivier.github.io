Having used Rails (and Django) in the past, and after reading The Rails 5
Way, I got a bit used to the ruling principles of Rails: opinionated and
convention over configuration. Whether you like it or not, there is a way to
do things, and you'll have to follow the rules (or leave).

In a way, this is a real time and energy saver.
No need to argue with anyone about the pros and the cons of whatever the
possible toolkits to do whatever common task associated with web development.
No need to argue about other trivialities such as the most appropriate directory
structure to save the codes for your models.

When you inherit a Rails project, either you know Rails and you know where you
can expect to find stuff, or you don't know Rails and you first read The Rails Way.

I've been spoon-fed by Rails. Having done a few projects using Node, I knew about
the other *way* to build a server: the way where you can afford (the cost?) to choose
the most appropriate solution for your problem, or roll up your own.
